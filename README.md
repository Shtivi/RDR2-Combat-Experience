# RDR2-Bounties-Expansion
A mod that aims to expand and enhance the bounty hunting side activity in the game, with endless missions available to play and random encounters integrated in the world .

### Installation:
- Download and install AB's ScripthookRDR2: http://www.dev-c.com/rdr2/scripthookrdr2/
- Make sure you have an asi loader, it usually comes along with Scripthook.
- Copy *BountiesExpansion.asi* and the *BountiesExpansion* folder to the game's root folder.
- Make sure there're full read & write permissions on BountiesExpansion folder.

### Quick start:
- Head over to one of the new bounty poster blips you see on the map.
- Collect the poster.
- Get to the target's location.
- Capture the target.
- Deliver the target to the town's police department and collect your reward.

### Random Events: 
The mod features various random events, making the bounty hunting experience much more lively.
- Rival bounty hunters will present in towns, collecting posters just like you. If you let them get away with a poster, the chance that they will come after your target (and get in your way) increases. 
- Turn targets in alive and you might watch them being publicly hanged in town a few days later.
- Bounty hunters with captured targets will present in the wilderness, making their way to a police department to turn it in. You can steal the target and get the reward for yourself.

### Improved enemies AI
Enemies AI is greatly improved from the first versions of the mod, allowing you taking advantage of stealth.
- Enemies will have harder time detecting you if you use silent weapons, walk crouched or hiding in the foliage.
- Enemies hearing and seeing range are influenced by the envrionment: weather conditions, time of day, etc.
- Enemies can now be lured from their positions. Play a short whistle or fire an arrow or a throwing knife near them to attract them.
- Bounty targets will spontaneously untie themselves when hogtied. If they're injured, the chances they attempt to escape will reduce. You can also hit them while on a horse back to prevent them from escaping.

### Additional features and misc:
- Bounty posters are available all around the map, as well as in post offices.
- All missions are auto generated, including target names, mission locations, mission difficulty and more. The mod features multiple mission scenarios for variety.
- Bounty posters have the same look & feel as the vanilla, with the original animations and UI.
- Lawmen and bystanders will react to you while delivering bounty targets to custody.
- Mission sets will be spawned before reaching their locations, allowing you to snipe your targets from afar or plan your attack. 
- Annesburg has been added along with dozens of new mission locations.
- Rewards will differ from town to town, according to how wealthy it is and the demand for bounty hunting services.
- Targets located far away from towns will have higher bounties.

- You need to edit only the right side.
